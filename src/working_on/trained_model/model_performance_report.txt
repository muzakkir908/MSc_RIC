MODEL PERFORMANCE REPORT

1. Test Set Performance:
   - Accuracy: 98.5%
   - Precision: 98%
   - Recall: 98-99%
   - F1-Score: 0.98

2. Expected Real-World Performance:
   - Controlled conditions: 92-95%
   - Varied conditions: 85-92%
   - Worst-case scenario: 80-85%

3. Why Current Accuracy is High:
   - Consistent player behavior in test data
   - Single game type (FPS)
   - Clean data collection environment
   - 2-second prediction window allows early detection

4. Limitations:
   - Limited to FPS games
   - Single player's patterns
   - Controlled network environment
   - May need retraining for different games

5. Conclusion:
   Even with conservative estimates (85-90%), the model
   significantly exceeds the 75% target requirement.
